## Introduction

This is a simple script to turn on and then disable **LightingService** which control the backlight of keyboards.

## Reason for script

My laptop ASUS GL503GE was having heating issue . The cluprit was  **LightingService** which took 10-15 % CPU utilization . So , I had to manually disable it . And when I needed the backlight functionality then enable it, run it and then disable it. So, I somewhat automated that process.

## Usage 

- Run the script as admin
- It will enable the lightening service and the keyboard lights will be lit . 
- Then it will ask for keyboard input that will disable the service and the script ends.
